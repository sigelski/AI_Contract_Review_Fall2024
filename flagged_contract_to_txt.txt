TERMINATION.
		Problem Category: Termination
		Common Problems: they want a hard stop date for reimbursements if there is an early termination
		Preferred Language: ['Expiration.  This Agreement will expire at the end of the Research Term, unless terminated prior to such date in accordance with this Section 11 or extended by written agreement of the parties.\n\nThis Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach of any of the terms herein.  Upon written notification, the breaching party shall have 30 days to cure such breach.  If such breach is not cured, the non-breaching party may deliver a Notice of Termination to the breaching party terminating the Agreement.   For a breach of non-payment of support by Sponsor, Auburn is under no obligation to continue work on the Project.  During such non-payment period and/or a termination of this Agreement for a non-payment breach, Auburn is under no obligation to conform to any of the Agreement terms herein, except Section 10 (Confidential Information) and Section 12 (Publicity).\nEither party may terminate performance of the Project in whole or in part if it is in the best interest of either party. The terminating party shall deliver a Notice of Termination specifying the basis of the termination, extent of termination and effective date.  Auburn will be paid for all services delivered and all non-cancelable commitments made prior to the date of termination. In the event that only a portion of effort is terminated, Auburn shall work diligently to continue all other efforts that remain active.\t']
		Why: we routinely have non-cancelable commitments such as purchase orders that are not returnable/refundable, grad students who get paid quarterly, etc.
		1st response to Sponsor: get the language "non-cancelable commitments" added

Either Party may terminate this Subaward Agreement upon the other Party’s non-compliance with any obligation under this Subaward Agreement and failure to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the non-breaching Party.
		Problem Category: PI Signature
		Common Problems: Sponsor will want the PI to sign the agreement as a Party.
		Preferred Language: []
		Why: Auburn faculty do not have signature authority and cannot be parties to agreements.
		1st response to Sponsor: change it to acknowledges.  They can sign as read & acknowledged if needed. Any language in the agreement requiring the PI to agree in writing should be edited to specify that the PI will agree or have agreed to follow the terms (not in writing)

*******************************************************************************************
Such events of non-compliance/breach may include, but are not limited to those described in Article 26 of the  Prime Award.
Upon termination of this Subaward Agreement for any reason, without waiver of either Party’s other rights and remedies, (i) Subawardee will cease work under this Subaward Agreement as of the effective date of termination and shall not incur any additional costs or perform any additional work under this Subaward Agreement without MIT’s prior written consent; (ii) a financial report shall be due to MIT within sixty (60) days of the effective date of the termination; (iii) Subawardee shall provide MIT with any Work Product created (and Datasets if applicable) prior to termination, including drafts; and (iv) MIT shall reimburse Subawardee for its costs and noncancelable commitments (unless such amounts for noncancelable commitments were incurred in connection with Subawardee’s breaches of this Subaward Agreement incurred in performance of the Purpose up to and including the effective date of termination, the total of which in no event shall exceed the total amount of the Authorized Total.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, either party shall have the right to invoke force majeure and terminate this Subaward in the event that proceeding with the Subawardee Research or material portions thereof would be inconsistent with applicable national, state, or local health advisories and restrictions or University-level policies regarding business travel or attendance at large group gatherings, due to the global public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
		Problem Category: Use of Name
		Common Problems: Acceptance of this Grant shall be deemed consent of the Grantee Institution to the publication of information, including the title of the project, the name and institutional affiliation of the Principal Investigator, the amount of the award and the non-technical project summary.  The non-technical summary shall not contain confidential information.
		Preferred Language: ["The parties will not use the name of the other or the other's Project staff in any publicity, advertising, or new release without the prior written consent of the other.  Sponsor will not state or imply that Auburn has tested or approved any product or process.  Auburn shall be free to announce receipt of funding in routine campus announcements."]
		Why: "including" and the other part in red infers that additional information can be published
		1st response to Sponsor: change "including" to "consisting of" and delete the other portion.  Also add the above
		Confidence: 0.24637114872417742

*******************************************************************************************
Parties do not expect to exchange confidential or proprietary information under this Subaward.
Should it become necessary for MIT and Subawardee to exchange such information, the Parties will enter into a separate agreement covering the exchange of such information including the terms and conditions of such exchange.
		*******************************************************************************************
[POTENTIAL PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE DETECTED]
Should the Subawardee require information of the Prime Sponsor which the Prime Sponsor considers to be confidential or proprietary, the Subawardee and Prime Sponsor shall enter into an agreement with regards to such information.
		Problem Category: Export Controls
		Common Problems: Sponsor will or may provide export controlled information
		Preferred Language: ["(If receiving export-controlled info):\n“It is Auburn’s policy to remain fully in compliance at all times with all U.S. export control regulations, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations; International Traffic in Arms Regulations; and embargo sanctions under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\tTherefore, in the event that SPONSOR wishes to provide export controlled data or information to Auburn during the course of activity under this Agreement, SPONSOR must first notify Auburn of its intention to provide this data at least thirty (30) days in advance of actually providing this data or information and provide the Export Control classification of such data under the ITAR or EAR. Auburn will then determine whether Auburn can accept such data, as well as the conditions for such receipt if agreed upon. Auburn will then communicate this determination back to SPONSOR within seven (7) days of such determination.”\n \n(If not receiving export-controlled info):\n“It is Auburn's policy to remain fully in compliance at all times with all U.S. export control regulations, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations; International Traffic in Arms Regulations; and embargo sanctions under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). No export controlled information will be provided to Auburn by the SPONSOR.”"]
		Why: If we accept export control language, we are no longer operating in a Fundamental research environment so we would not have the exclusion to export controls. 
		1st response to Sponsor: add the following statement: "Therefore, in the event that SPONSOR wishes to provide export controlled data or information to Auburn during the course of activity under this Agreement, SPONSOR must first notify Auburn of its intention to provide this data at least thirty (30) days in advance of actually providing this data or information and provide the Export Control classification of such data under the ITAR or EAR.

GOVERNING LAW.
		Problem Category: Govering Law
		Common Problems: other states/countries for law
		Preferred Language: ['The validity and interpretation of this Agreement and the legal relationship of the parties, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama without regard to conflict of law rules or principles.  Exclusive jurisdiction shall be in the State of Alabama.']
		Why: As an instrumentality of the State of Alabama, Auburn University is granted sovereign immunity under Article I, Section 14 of the Alabama Constitution, and under the 11th Amendment to the United States Consitutions. Auburn University does not have the authority to waive its sovereign immunity. Further, Alabama Code makes it clear that the exclusive venue for any claim for damages against Auburn must be the Alabama State Board of Adjustment, which exists to resolve all claims against the State or any of its institutions, arising out of any contract to which its institutions are parties, where there is claimed a legal or moral obligation resting on the state.”  Because of this, Auburn cannot agree to be subjected to the legal process of any jurisdiction other than the State of Alabama.  
		1st response to Sponsor: Revise the agreement to the preferred language

The Parties shall follow the procedures set forth in the article to facilitate a resolution and attempt to avoid litigation.
The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the existence of the dispute.
In the event the negotiations fail to resolve the dispute, the Parties agree to share the costs of retaining a licensed mediator and to participate, in good faith, with the mediation effort.
In the event the mediation effort is unsuccessful, the Parties may pursue other means of dispute resolution, including arbitration, or proceed to litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The Parties shall each be responsible for all of their own costs of mediation and/or other dispute resolution.
Pending any decision, appeal or judgment on the settlement of any dispute arising under this Subaward, the Subawardee shall proceed diligently with the performance of this Subaward.
EXPORT CONTROLS.
Each Party will comply with all applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Export Administration Regulations and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
Both Parties represent that it will use reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure or delivery to the other Party of any information, materials, tangible items, data, software or technology that carries an export classification more restrictive than EAR 99 (collectively, “Restricted Technology”), without first obtaining the advance written consent of the other Party’s Export Control Officer.
If either Party learns that it has or may have disclosed or delivered Restricted Technology to the other Party or otherwise breached this Article, the disclosing Party shall immediately provide detailed written notice to each of the other Party and that Party’s Principal Investigator, and work cooperatively to address the breach.
INCORPORATION OF PRIME AWARD.
This Subaward Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of the Prime Award included hereto in Attachment D, including all attachments to and incorporations into said Prime Award.
Subawardee shall assume towards MIT all obligations, responsibilities, promises, representations, and warranties which MIT, under the Prime Award, assumes towards the Prime Sponsor.
Subawardee further assumes all obligations, responsibilities, promises, representations, and warranties that said Prime Award otherwise requires MIT to secure from subrecipients in order for MIT to fulfill its obligations under said Prime Award.
In addition to the terms and conditions explicitly detailed in this Subaward Agreement, the following Prime Award requirements are flowed down to the Subawardee as described in the following Articles: 9, 21, 22, 23, & 24, 28, Exhibit A, & Exhibit C to the Prime Award.
In reading the Prime Award flowdown terms, “Grantee” shall be read as “Subawardee” and “Grantor” shall be read as MIT.
The following Prime Award Articles shall not apply to Subawardee: Articles: 1, 3, 4, 6, 10 & 11, 27.
Reports, disclosures, and communications under these terms: Notwithstanding the above, Subawardee shall deliver any reports or other communications, make any disclosures, otherwise deliver any tangible or intangible property and seek any authorizations that are required by this Article 22 to MIT except when the plain text of the Prime Award, if interpreted without regard to the remainder of this Subaward, would expressly permit or require Subawardee to make such conveyance directly to the Prime Sponsor or to Funder.
		*******************************************************************************************
[POTENTIAL PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE DETECTED]
Prior approval for activity: Subawardee will obtain prior approval from MIT before undertaking any activity for which Prime Sponsor requires prior approval from MIT.
		Problem Category: Publications
		Common Problems: prior approval over the substantive content of information, data and/or results in publications or presentations, 

		Preferred Language: ["The parties agree that Auburn may publish the results of the work in its own form.  In all publications, Sponsor will remain anonymous and proper confidentiality will be maintained, unless otherwise specified by Sponsor.\nAt Sponsor’s request, Auburn will provide a copy of any proposed publication sixty (60) days in advance of submission to review for confidential information and language which would affect any potential patent filings.  Sponsor's review will be completed and any objections made within this period.  Fair consideration shall be given to Sponsor’s comments."]
		Why: Auburn, as a public educational institution of the State of Alabama, has the dissemination of knowledge and information as a primary mission.   Requiring control or approval over the content of the publication is a deal breaker for Auburn.  The University cannot accept agreement language that prohibits the publication of research results or allows for the sponsor to approve or disapprove the publication in whole or in part without an overriding reason.
Publication restrictions eliminate the fundamental research exemption from export control laws.
		1st response to Sponsor: remove any prior approval language
